    <h2>Welcome to VeritasOne</h2>
    <p>Join us on our journey to redefine the future of healthcare—where your data, your decisions, and your health truly come first.</p>

    <h3>Empowering Patients Through Transparent Data Management</h3>
    <p>At VeritasOne, our vision is to empower patients by putting control of their healthcare data directly in their hands. We are on a mission to revolutionize how medical records are managed and shared.</p>

    <p>Our <span class="highlight">free, unified EMR</span> platform consolidates your medical data from every provider and hospital into one secure, patient‐centered repository that continually updates throughout your life.</p>

    <p>Unlike other platforms, we empower you to take control of your health data, <span class="highlight">allowing you to monetize it</span> on your own terms while contributing to groundbreaking medical research.</p>

    <h3>Most people don’t realize...</h3>
    <p>...that their identifiable health data is already being sold—without their knowledge or consent. Insurance companies sell billing data to pharma and marketing firms; Big Tech collects search/device data to infer conditions; wearable devices sell “anonymized” biometric data that can be re‐identified, and so on.</p>

    <h3>What Sets Us Apart</h3>
    <p><strong>Strict Privacy Mode:</strong> Your data is for your eyes only. Share with doctors or family if you choose—never shared without permission.</p>
    <p><strong>De‐Identified Data for Health Research:</strong> Contribute to research anonymously while earning a share of the profits.</p>
    <p><strong>Full Data Sharing (Research + Ads):</strong> Choose to share all your data in exchange for additional monetization opportunities.</p>
